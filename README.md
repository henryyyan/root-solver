# root-solver
This is a MATLAB program that combines the bisection and inverse quadratic interpolation methods to find the root of a function on a given interval. In particular, this code numerically solves the equation $f(x) = 0$, where $f$ is some continuous real-valued function, on a given interval $[a, b]$, given that $f(a) \cdot f(b) \leq 0$. Trivially, this program can be used to solve any equation of the form $f(x) = g(x)$, for continuous real-valued functions $f, g$, by inputting $h(x) := f(x) - g(x)$ into the program.
