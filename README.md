# root-solver
This is a MATLAB program which combines the bisection and inverse quadratic interpolation methods to find a root of a solution. In particular, this code numerically solves the equation $f(x) = 0$, where $f$ is some continuous real valued function, on an given interval $[a, b]$, given that $f(a) \cdot f(b) \leq 0$.
